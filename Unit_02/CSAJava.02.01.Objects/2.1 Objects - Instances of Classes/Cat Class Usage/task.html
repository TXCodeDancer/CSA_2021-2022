    and using instances of Java classes called <strong>objects</strong>.
    this task includes two classes, Main and Cat. Your objective is to write the missing
    code in the Main class to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Output information for each cat instance to the console.</li>
    <li>Modify the status of the cat named <strong>Ben</strong> to record that he is sleeping. </li>
</ul>
